# Terminal's Blog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3, by a TerminalMontage's fan.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

#About the project
The project was created to show the use of Angular in a SPA blog. It uses components, routes and dynamic content (read in data.ts).

At this moment, the project is in development. I'm increasing another details, like a complete design for him, including a responsive design and more content for the blog.
